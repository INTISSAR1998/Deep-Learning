These representations are frequently informative for your own computer vision task, even though the task may be quite different from the problem that the original model was trained on. This versatility and repurposability of convnets is one of the most interesting aspects of deep learning.\n","\n","In our case, we will use the [Inception V3 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) developed at Google, and pre-trained on [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/), a large dataset of web images (1.4M images and 1000 classes). This is a powerful model; let's see what the features that it has learned can do for our cat vs. dog problem.\n","\n","First, we need to pick which intermediate layer of Inception V3 we will use for feature extraction. A common practice is to use the output of the very last layer before the `Flatten` operation, the so-called \"bottleneck layer.\" The reasoning here is that the following fully connected layers will be too specialized for the task the network was trained on, and thus the features learned by these layers won't be very useful for a new task.

If you add a randomly initialized classifier on top of a pretrained model and attempt to train all layers jointly, the magnitude of the gradient updates will be too large (due to the random weights from the classifier), and your pretrained model will just forget everything it has learned.\n","- Additionally, we **fine-tune only the *top layers* of the pre-trained model** rather than all layers of the pretrained model because, in a convnet, the higher up a layer is, the more specialized it is. The first few layers in a convnet learn very simple and generic features, which generalize to almost all types of images.
